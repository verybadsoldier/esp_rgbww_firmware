 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * @section PLAN
 * holding the config struct in RAM seems wasteful. Also, having two entirely different
 * sets of code to serialize/deserialize the config struct for the API and load store 
 * is less than ideal. 
 * Also, the json representation of the base struct can outgrow the 1370Bytes allowed 
 * in a single http request and there may not be enough RAM to assemble multiple fragents 
 * or tcp packets.
 * 
 * ConfigDB (https://github.com/mikee47/ConfigDB) is a library that can store and retrieve
 * json based configuration data. It requires a filesystem to store the data, ideally LittleFS 
 * to leveage the copy on write feature.
 * 
 * this will be a major change as the config struct will be replaced by ConfigDB 
 *
